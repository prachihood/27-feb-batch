# AI in FinTech
## Introduction
The evolution of global technology over the years has made **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and machine learning part of enterprise vocabulary. Coined by *John McCarthy* in 1956 first, AI has become extremely popular among sizeable organizations today due to the volume of data these firms deal in. Findings from McKinsey Global Survey on AI 2021 indicates that AI adoption is continuing its steady rise: 56% of all respondentsâ€™ reported AI adoption in at least one function, up from 50% in 2020. The growth in demand of AI expanded as businesses required better understanding of data patterns. AI involves advanced algorithms that adhere to a mathematical function, which can carry out greater processes similar to humans. 
## Types of AI
1. Weak AI
2. Strong AI
### Weak AI
Weak AI or `Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)` is a system put up to simply fulfil a specific task. For example - `Siri and Alexa`. Weak AI works as per the set rules, the algorithms are bound by the rules and do not go beyond the commands. This categorization is rooted in the difference between unsupervised and supervised programming. While voice-activated assistance, like Siri, often has a programmed response, it is sensing for things similar to what it knows and classifying them accordingly. Hence, voice-activated assistance is considered weak AI.

### Strong AI
Strong artificial intelligence (AI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI) or general AI is a system that has robust and massive functionalities and capabilities. This certain mindset of AI development can broadly imitate the human brain. Strong AI aims to create intelligent machines that are indistinguishable from the human mind. [^1] But just like a child, the AI machine would have to learn through input and experiences, constantly progressing and advancing its abilities over time.

That is so funny! :joy:

	I need to highlight these ==very important words==.
